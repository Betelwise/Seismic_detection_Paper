# Basic configuration for latexindent.pl
# This file should be named latexindent.yaml and placed in your project's root directory.

# --- General Settings ---
# For more options, refer to the latexindent.pl documentation:
# type "texdoc latexindent" in your terminal or search for it on CTAN.

# --- Line Break Modifications ---
# This section controls how lines are broken.
modifyLineBreaks:
  # This is a key option to enable text wrapping.
  # It tries to wrap lines of text (like in paragraphs or items)
  # to a certain column width.
  textWrapOptions:
    # Set your desired column width for text wrapping.
    # 80 is a common choice, but you can adjust it.
    columns: 80
    # You can also tell it to try and break before certain characters
    # if it helps, e.g., before prepositions or conjunctions.
    # breakBefore:
    #   - 'and'
    #   - 'or'
    #   - 'but'
    #   - 'for'
    #   - 'a'
    #   - 'an'
    #   - 'the'
    #   - 'of'
    #   - 'in'
    #   - 'on'
    #   - 'at'
    #   - 'to'
    #   - 'from'
    #   - 'with'
    #   - 'by'
    #   - 'as'
    #   - 'if'
    #   - 'when'
    #   - 'while'
    #   - 'where'
    #   - 'because'
    #   - 'although'
    #   - 'though'
    #   - 'since'
    #   - 'unless'
    #   - 'until'
    #   - 'so'
    #   - 'that'
    #   - 'which'
    #   - 'who'
    #   - 'whom'
    #   - 'whose'

  # You can also specify how to handle indentation for wrapped lines.
  # For example, indent wrapped lines by 2 spaces:
  # indentation: 2 # This might be a default or controlled elsewhere too.

# --- Indentation of Environments and Braces ---
# Default indentation settings are usually quite good.
# Example: Indent 'itemize' environments by 2 spaces.
# indentationOperations:
#   environments:
#     itemize:
#       indentAfterBeginning: 2
#       indentBeforeEnd: 0

# --- Spacing ---
# Controls spacing around operators, commas, etc.
# Defaults are often sensible.
# For example, ensure one space after commas:
# spacingAfter:
#   comma: 1
